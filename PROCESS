# Workshop Process

1) Gather parts
- 7‑LED WS2812B strip segment, Arduino Nano (or ESP32), 330–470 Ω resistor, 1000 µF electrolytic capacitor (≥6.3 V), wires, multi‑port USB‑A charger, short USB cables.

2) Prepare power
- Use a USB‑A charger. Either cut a USB‑A cable (red=+5V, black=GND) or use a USB‑A screw‑terminal breakout.

3) Solder the strip power
- Red to 5V, black to GND on the strip.
- Add a 1000 µF cap across 5V and GND near the first LED (observe polarity).

4) Data wiring
- MCU data pin (e.g., D6) -> 330–470 Ω series resistor -> DIN on the strip.

5) Common ground
- Connect MCU GND to strip GND.

6) 3.3 V MCUs (ESP32/ESP8266/RP2040)
- Use a 74AHCT125/74HCT14 level shifter on data OR drop LED V+ to ~4.3–4.5 V with a silicon diode in series.

7) Software setup
- Install Arduino IDE and Adafruit NeoPixel library (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries).
- Select board and port, open `code/starter_nano/starter_nano.ino`, set `NUM_LEDS=7` and `PIN`, then upload.

8) Power-up order
- Power the LED strip from the charger first, then connect the MCU; keep data wire short.

9) Test patterns and adjust brightness
- Use the starter sketch to verify colors; adjust `BRIGHTNESS` as needed.

10) Cleanup and safety
- Strain‑relief cables, insulate joints with heatshrink, and avoid exposing any mains wiring.
