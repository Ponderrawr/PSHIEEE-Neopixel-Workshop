# PSHIEEE-Neopixel-Workshop
Covering the basics of how to power and code Neopixels with an Arduino Nano.
Title: IEEE NeoPixel Workshop (Penn State)
Overview: Build a 7-LED NeoPixel project using an Arduino Nano (or ESP32) powered separately from a USB charger. This repo has starter code, wiring, power notes, and troubleshooting.
Quick Start:
Install Arduino IDE
Install “Adafruit NeoPixel” library
Open code/starter_nano/starter_nano.ino, set NUM_LEDS = 7, choose your data pin, upload

Power: docs/POWER.md
Process: docs/PROCESS.md
Troubleshooting: docs/TROUBLESHOOT.md
BOM: bom/BOM.md
Safety:
Do not power LEDs from the Nano’s 5V pin
Always connect LED GND to MCU GND
