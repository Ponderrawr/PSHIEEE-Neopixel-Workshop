# Troubleshooting

- No lights:
  - Verify ~5 V on the strip (red-to-black).
  - Confirm common ground between MCU and strip.
  - Check data pin number and library installed.

- Flicker/garbage colors:
  - Ensure 330–470 Ω series resistor on data.
  - Shorten the data wire; twist with ground.
  - For 3.3 V MCUs, add a 74AHCT125/74HCT14 level shifter or lower LED V+.

- Brownout or white looks yellow/pink:
  - Reduce brightness or use thicker/shorter power leads.
  - Check USB cable gauge (prefer 22–24 AWG for power).

- Upload failures (Nano clones):
  - Install CH340 driver.
  - Try “ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)” in Arduino IDE if needed.
  - Check the correct COM port.
