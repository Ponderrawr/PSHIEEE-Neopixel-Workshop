# Power Guide

- Current draw:
  - WS2812B worst case ≈ 60 mA/LED (full white, full brightness).
  - One 7‑LED strip ≈ 0.42 A worst case.
- Recommended supplies:
  - Multi‑port USB‑A chargers (2.4 A per port is ample for one strip).
  - Keep power cables short (1 ft) to minimize voltage drop.
- Central PSU option:
  - A 5V/20 A supply with fused distribution can power many strips; enclose mains and fuse each branch (~1 A).
- Do not power the LEDs from the Arduino’s 5V pin.
- Always tie grounds between the strip and MCU.
- Cap brightness in code (e.g., 25–40%) for comfort and headroom.
