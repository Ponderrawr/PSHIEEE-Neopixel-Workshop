# Wiring Guide

Schematic overview:
- USB charger +5V -> LED strip 5V
- USB charger GND -> LED strip GND
- Microcontroller GND -> LED strip GND (common ground)
- Microcontroller D6 (example) -> 330–470 Ω -> LED DIN
- 1000 µF electrolytic cap across LED 5V/GND near LED 1

Tips:
- Keep the data wire short (<30–50 cm). For longer runs, use a proper level shifter and twist data with ground.
- Do not connect the strip +5V to the MCU 5V pin if the MCU is also plugged into a computer via USB.
- For Nano/5V boards: drive DIN directly through the series resistor.
- For ESP32/3.3 V boards: use 74AHCT125/74HCT14 or lower LED V+ with a diode.
